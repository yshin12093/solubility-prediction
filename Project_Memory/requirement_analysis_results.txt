# REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS RESULTS

## MAIN OBJECTIVE
Develop a transformer-based machine learning model to predict the solubility of small molecules represented by SMILES strings.

## DATA SOURCES
- solubility_esol.csv: Contains SMILES representations of molecules and their corresponding solubility values

## EXPECTED DELIVERABLES
1. A transformer model architecture for molecular solubility prediction
2. Training and evaluation pipeline for the model
3. Performance metrics on test data
4. Code documentation and usage instructions

## KEY CONSTRAINTS/CRITERIA
- Input data format: SMILES strings for molecular representation
- Output: Numerical solubility prediction (regression task)
- Model type: Must use transformer architecture
- Evaluation metrics should include standard regression metrics (e.g., RMSE, RÂ²)
- The model should effectively learn from the chemical structure patterns in the SMILES notation
