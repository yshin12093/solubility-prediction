# DATA PREPROCESSING PLAN

## 1. Feature Engineering for Transformer Input
- SMILES tokenization: Character-level with special tokens for structural elements
- Generate 3 augmented non-canonical SMILES per molecule to improve generalization
- Extract key molecular descriptors: LogP, MW, HBond donors/acceptors, TPSA, aromatic rings, 
rotatable bonds
- Normalize all descriptors using z-score standardization, capping outliers at 5σ

## 2. Sequence Processing
- Maximum SMILES sequence length: 128 tokens (covers >95% of dataset)
- Padding strategy: Right-padding with [PAD] tokens
- Apply sinusoidal positional encodings to preserve molecular structure information

## 3. Missing Value Handling
- Molecular descriptors: Replace rare missing values with median of training set
- SMILES representation: Complete by design, no missing values expected

## 4. Imbalance Approaches (for Regression Task)
- Apply stratified sampling based on log solubility quartiles for balanced representation
- Oversample poorly represented regions (highly soluble compounds) by 20%

## 5. Transformer-Ready Data
- Input tensor dimensions: [batch_size, seq_length, embedding_dim] = [32, 128, 256]
- Dataset split: 70% training (790 compounds), 15% validation (169), 15% test (169)
- Distribution across solubility ranges preserved in all splits
- Molecular descriptor embeddings: 10 features → 64-dim vector via linear projection
- Estimated storage: ~100MB for processed dataset (within 5GB constraint)
