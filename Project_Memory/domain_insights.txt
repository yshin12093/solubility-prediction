# DOMAIN INSIGHTS

## KEY DOMAIN PATTERNS TO ANTICIPATE
Molecular solubility typically follows Lipinski's rule of five and is strongly influenced 
by hydrophilic/hydrophobic group distribution, with more complex aromatic ring structures 
and halogenated compounds generally showing lower solubility values as seen in the dataset.

## PRIORITY FEATURES BASED ON DOMAIN EXPERTISE
1. Molecular weight and size (larger molecules tend to be less soluble)
2. Number and types of functional groups (especially H-bond donors/acceptors)
3. LogP (octanol-water partition coefficient) as derived from SMILES
4. Topological polar surface area (TPSA)
5. Aromatic ring count and complexity

## CRITICAL THRESHOLDS/BENCHMARKS
- RMSE < 1.0 log units for solubility prediction is considered good performance
- RÂ² > 0.7 indicates strong predictive capability
- Average absolute error < 0.7 log units for practical application
- Log solubility values range from approximately +1.1 to -8.6 in the dataset

## SIGNIFICANT EXTERNAL FACTORS
1. Temperature effects on solubility (not captured in static SMILES)
2. pH sensitivity of certain functional groups
3. Solvent interactions beyond water (dataset appears to be aqueous solubility)
4. Crystal lattice energy for solid compounds
5. Conformational flexibility of molecules affecting solvation
