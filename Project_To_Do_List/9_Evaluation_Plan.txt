   - For classification problems, always include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR (briefly explain each)
   - Justify the metric selection

# CONSTRAINT: The evaluation should be feasible on a computer with 16GB of RAM.

# DELIVERABLE:
evaluation_plan.txt (< 150 words) in the "Project_Memory" folder. Use bullets and short sentences.
