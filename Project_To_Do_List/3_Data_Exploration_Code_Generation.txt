3. DATA EXPLORATION - Code Generation

# INSTRUCTIONS: 
In this task, code for data exploration is generated (no execution yet). 

Create a Python scripts to explore datasets in "Project_Input" folder and to generate an HTML report (data_exploration.html).
Do not excute the scripts.

Requirements:
	1	Create modular files that follow clear separation of concerns.
	2	All files should have less than 100 lines of code.
	3	Store the exploration outputs (plots, html report, etc.) in "Project_Artifacts/Data_Exploration" folder.
	4	Make the exploration comprehensive yet concise. 

Analysis Framework:
	1	Data Overview
		- Load datasets and examine basic dimensions
		- Identify key variables for analysis 
		- Check for presence of time-series data and show example plots
	2	Essential Quality Checks
		- Quantify missing values
		- Detect significant outliers in numeric fields
		- Check for class imbalance
	3	Basic Variable Analysis
		- Generate summary statistics for numeric variables
		- Create frequency tables for categorical variables
