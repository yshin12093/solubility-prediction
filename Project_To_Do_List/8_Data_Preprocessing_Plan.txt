8. Data Preprocessing Plan

# INSTRUCTIONS: Develop a data preprocessing plan for the transformer model input, based on the files in the "Project_Memory" folder.

1. Feature Engineering for Transformer Input
   - Describe if any feature engineering is needed for the transformer input

2. Time-series Processing 
   - Determine sequence length for time-varying features
   - Specify windowing strategies (if applicable) with clinical justification
   - Define how to encode temporal gaps and irregular sampling in medical data

3. Missing Value Handling 
   - Propose techniques for addressing missing values
   - Specify imputation methods appropriate for time-series data

4. Class Imbalance Approaches 
   - Detail sampling strategies compatible with transformer inputs
   - Compare before and after class imbalance handling

5. Transformer-Ready Data 
   - Define the final tensor structure (be specific values)
   - Number of training, validation, and test sets (for imbalanced data, define the number of positive and negative samples)
   - Specify token embedding dimensions, sequence lengths, and batch sizing

# CONSTRAINT: The data should be processed on a computer with 16GB of RAM and available storage of 5 GB.

# DELIVERABLE: 
data_preprocessing_plan.txt (< 250 words) to be stored in the "Project_Memory" folder.
Use bullets and short sentences.
