	2	Include relevant scientific databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, etc.).
	3	Use both broad and specific search terms related to the topic.

Required Information to Extract:

	1	Data Preprocessing
		- Handling missing data
		- Feature engineering techniques 
		- Normalization approaches for diverse data types
		- Techniques for addressing class imbalance and outliers
		- Multi-modal data fusion techniques

	2	Model Selection
		- Comparative analyses of model types/architectures 
		- Integration of domain expertise into model development
		- Transformer models for multi-modal data fusion
		
	3	Evaluation Methodologies
		- Commonly-used metrics
		- Methods addressing bias and fairness considerations
		- Techniques for model explainability and interpretability

# ANTI-HALLUCINATION: If you're unsure about any information, please explicitly state your uncertainty rather than making up.

# DELIVERABLE:  Store a concise document titled "literature_search_results.txt" (< 250 words) in the folder "Project_Memory" that:
	1	Summarizes key advancements in each area
	2	Highlights consensus vs. contested approaches
	3	Identifies practical implementation considerations
	4	Provides citations to seminal papers for further reading
	5	Outlines emerging trends and promising research directions
	6   Add references and links for further reading
	Use bullets and short sentences.
