11. ML CODE GENERATION

# INSTRUCTIONS: Using the file "combined_plan.txt" in the "Project_Memory" folder, develop a complete implementation 
using PyTorch. The code should include data preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation components. 

# CONSTRAINT: The implementation should be feasible on a computer with 16GB of RAM and available storage of 5GB.

# EXAMPLE CODE: Make use of the example code in the "Project_Resources" directory.

# DELIVERABLE:
1 Python scripts and other files including README.md in the "Project_Artifacts/ML_Code" directory.
2 ml_code_generation_results.txt (< 250 words) in the "Project_Memory" directory, 
  which describes how the implementation reflects the original plan, including:
    - Implementation of multimodal fusion pipeline
    - Implementation of dataset imbalance handling (if applicable)
    - Implementation of evaluation metrics
